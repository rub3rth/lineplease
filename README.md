<b>LINEPLEASE</b>

Lineplease is a helper script (bash) designed to simplify the process of grabbing reverse shell oneliners from the web<br>
and changing them to fit whatever need.
<br>
Started out as a simple personal tool to help my own lazy self but grew into a somewhat comprehensive list of lines<br>
easily served up on the command line.<br>
Check README.txt for the different options and how to use them.<br>
<br>
Most if not all creds goes to [PayloadAlltheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) for the actual lines.<br>
<br>

Enjoy!
